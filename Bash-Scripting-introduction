## History of Bash
- Bash scripting originated from the Bourne Shell (sh) developed in the 1970s as the first Unix shell for automation. 
  In 1989, Brian Fox created Bash (Bourne Again SHell) for the GNU Project as a free, enhanced alternative, combining features from sh, ksh, and csh.
  By the 1990s, Bash became the default shell on most Linux systems and later spread to macOS as well. 
  Over time, it gained advanced scripting features like arrays, better string handling, and command substitution. 
  Today, Bash remains a widely used scripting language in Linux/Unix environments, powering system automation, DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud computing.

- Brian Fox(FSF employee) began coding on bash and released Bash asbeta , version 0.99 on june 8,
 1989. Brian Fox remained in FSF as the primary Bash maintainner till 1993. Then he laid off from FSF,
 and chet Ramey (earlier contributor in FSF) got his responsibility.
