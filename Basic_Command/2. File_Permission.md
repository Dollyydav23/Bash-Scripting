**File Permission**

# Linux File Authorization Model
Since Linux is a multi-user operating system, it must ensure proper security so that one user cannot access anotherâ€™s confidential files. To achieve this, Linux manages authorization at two levels:
---
## 1. Ownership
Every file or directory in Linux is associated with three types of owners:
- **User** â†’ The person who created the file (owner).  
- **Group** â†’ A set of users who share the same access permissions for that file or directory.  
- **Others** â†’ All remaining users on the system who are not the owner or part of the group.
## 2. Permissions 
Each of the above ownership types can be assigned different permissions:
| Symbol | Permission | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `r`    | Read       | View file contents / list directory contents |
| `w`    | Write      | Modify file / add, remove, rename inside directory |
| `x`    | Execute    | Run a file as a program / enter and access directory |
| `-`    | None       | No permission (If a permission is not granted, it is represented by a dash) |

There is a need to restrict own file/directory access to others.

**Change access:** The chmod command is used to change the access mode of a file. This command is used to set permissions (read, write, execute) on a file/directory for the owner, group and the others group.

### Syntax
```bash
chmod [reference][operator][mode] filename

**Example:**
chmod ugo-rwx test.txt
- This removes read, write, and execute permissions for user, group, and others.

# ðŸ§® Modes of `chmod`

There are two ways to use the `chmod` command in Linux:

---

## 1. Absolute Mode (Octal Representation)

Permissions are represented by a **three-digit octal number**.

| Permission Type          | Number | Symbol |
|---------------------------|--------|--------|
| No Permission             | 0      | ---    |
| Execute                   | 1      | --x    |
| Write                     | 2      | -w-    |
| Write + Execute           | 3      | -wx    |
| Read                      | 4      | r--    |
| Read + Execute            | 5      | r-x    |
| Read + Write              | 6      | rw-    |
| Read + Write + Execute    | 7      | rwx    |

### Example
```bash
chmod 764 test.txt

This sets:

User â†’ rwx (read, write, execute)

Group â†’ rw- (read, write)

Others â†’ r-- (read only)

# 2.  Symbolic Mode in Linux

In **symbolic mode**, permissions are modified for specific owners.

---

## ðŸ‘¤ Owners

| Symbol | Description  |
|--------|--------------|
| `u`    | user/owner   |
| `g`    | group        |
| `o`    | others       |
| `a`    | all          |

---

## âž•âž–âž— Operators

| Symbol | Description          |
|--------|---------------------|
| `+`    | Adds permission     |
| `-`    | Removes permission  |
| `=`    | Assigns permission  |

---

# ðŸ‘¥ Changing File Ownership

The `chown` command is used to change file **owner** and **group**.

### Syntax
```bash
chown user filename
chown user:group filename
